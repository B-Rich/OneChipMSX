Need a simple ZPU-based module to handle loading a boot rom from SD card,
then handle a simple OSD which will be used to control DIP switches.
The ZPU module needs to have the ability to pause the main CPU
so it can load DIP switch settings before allowing the OCMSX to boot.

OSD will comprise a single M4K character RAM, allowing 32 x 16 character
text display, or alternatively, 64x8 character.
The character ROM will contain 128 characters, 8 bytes per character, 
so 1024 bytes, 8192 bits, so 2 M4Ks.

The OSD ROM will probably end up being in the region of 16 M4ks.
